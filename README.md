This is a simple package for handling the most common data structures

## Installation

First we need to create a composer project.

Go inside your composer project and open your `composer.json` file, here you must add the follow lines.

```json
{
  "require": {
    "devinson/architect": "dev-main"
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/DevinsonAlvarez/architect.git"
    }
